    <h2>Pasta Fazool (Pasta e Fagioli)</h2>
    <p>
      Pasta fazool is classic Italian American comfort food. This recipe works
      with any sausage, but I like the fennel and anise flavors of sweet Italian
      sausage with the beans. A hearty soup that's fast and easy to put
      together.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>Onion and Garlic</li>
      <li>Tomato Products</li>
      <li>12 ounces sweet bulk Italian sausage</li>
      <li>Spices</li>
      <li>Noodles</li>
      <li>Â¾ cup dry elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in
        the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat
        to medium. Add diced celery and chopped onion. Cook until onions are
        translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add dry pasta; cook and stir for 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in tomato paste until evenly distributed, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in 3
        cups broth; increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Stir in red
        pepper flakes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and let
        simmer, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Add more broth if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chopped chard in a bowl. Cover with cold water and rinse leaves;
        any grit will fall to the bottom of the bowl. Transfer chard to a
        colander to drain briefly; add to soup. Cook and stir until leaves wilt,
        2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in white beans; continue cooking and stirring until pasta is
        tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in grated cheese.
        Serve topped with additional grated cheese.
